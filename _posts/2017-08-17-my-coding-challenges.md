title: My Coding Challenges

---

I spent a lot of time re-reading the first couple checkpoints of my Ruby on Rails curriculum. I thought, "there's so many phrases, and concepts here, I have to write everything down." But when you try to single out everything, you end up singling out nothing. My notes quickly just became hand written versions of the Bloc checkpoints. My first mentor (he wasn't good) told me to not worry with writing things down. Yes practice is better than note taking, but I took his advise as: read and move on. For a lot of Ruby on Rails checkpoints I didn't focus on the text much, I didn't write down notes, sometimes I probably let my focus fade away and I just ending up skimming the checkpoint. I was too concerned with getting into a console and typing up the code, that I didn't really make sure I slowed down to learn it first.

I had a lot of help during the front-end track. My mentor "held my hand" through a lot of the course work. I was able to recite the concepts sometimes, and I understood what he explained, but more often than not, I wasn't able write the code myself without some major errors. Eventually during the back-end track, especially with the foundation of having completed the Ruby on Rails curriculum, I was able to balance my learning/practicing of  concepts. I'll take notes if I have to re-read a definition, or a snippet of code. I have a better grasp of how to find the answer to a problem. In the past I could be just as easily confused by the answers I found as I was with the original problem I had.

Now with a better understanding of coding as a whole, I have the ability to go out and learn what I don't know, to try languages that don't initially make sense to me. I'm not where I want to be in terms of coding knowledge, but I've learned a lot during my time with Bloc. I now know, at least for me, coding is going to take maybe twice as long as you assume it will take.
